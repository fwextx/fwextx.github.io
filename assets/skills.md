# About Me

Hi there! I'm a passionate **Python developer** and **Full-stack Developer** based in **Seattle, Washington**. I love building open source scalable python/web projects to make the web better - one project at a time.

## My Skills:

- **Python Development**  
  I work on everything from network tools and automation scripts to full-stack applications.
- **Web Development**  
  I make web projects (full-stack) with nice modern UIs and AI Web Projects ([extx.ai](https://github.com/fwextx/extx.ai)).
